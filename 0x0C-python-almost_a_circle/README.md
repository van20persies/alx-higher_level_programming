- Advanced

### Mandatory

- tests/ &rarr; All tests of the project.

- models/(base.py,\__init__.py) &rarr; Write the first class Base.

- models/rectangle.py &rarr; Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base.

- models/rectangle.py &rarr; Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded).

- models/rectangle.py &rarr; Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.

- models/rectangle.py &rarr; Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.

- models/rectangle.py &rarr; Update the class Rectangle by overriding the \__str__ method so that it returns \[Rectangle] (<\id>) <\x>/<\y> - <\width>/<\height>

- models/rectangle.py &rarr; Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y.

- models/rectangle.py &rarr; Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def update(self, *args): that assigns an argument to each attribute.

- models/rectangle.py &rarr; Update the class Rectangle by updating the public method def update(self, *args): by changing the prototype to update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns a key/value argument to attributes.

- models/square.py &rarr; Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle.

- models/square.py &rarr; Update the class Square by adding the public getter and setter size.

- models/square.py &rarr; Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns attributes.

- models/base.py &rarr; Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Rectangle.

- models/base.py &rarr; Update the class Square by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Square.

- models/base.py &rarr; Update the class Base by adding the static method def to_json_string(list_dictionaries): that returns the JSON string representation of list_dictionaries.

- models/base.py &rarr; Update the class Base by adding the class method def save_to_file(cls, list_objs): that writes the JSON string representation of list_objs to a file.

- models/base.py &rarr; Update the class Base by adding the static method def from_json_string(json_string): that returns the list of the JSON string representation json_string.

- models/base.py &rarr; Update the class Base by adding the class method def create(cls, **dictionary): that returns an instance with all attributes already set

- models/base.py &rarr; Update the class Base by adding the class method def load_from_file(cls): that returns a list of instances.

### Advanced

- models/ &rarr; Update the class Base by adding the class methods def save_to_file_csv(cls, list_objs): and def load_from_file_csv(cls): that serializes and deserializes in CSV.

- odels/base.py &rarr; Update the class Base by adding the static method def draw(list_rectangles, list_squares): that opens a window and draws all the Rectangles and Squares.
